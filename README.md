# WM-Portfolio #

## Description ##
With what I have learned so far through 3 weeks of the course, I have designed a responsive website template to update as I
create more projects along the way. Hopefully, this portfolio website will serve me well in my future career search and moreover
be a fun place to share my new personal projects.

This deployed portfolio website is my first attempt at utilizing flexbox, media queries/responsive design, and CSS custom properties to help
build a website. I will update and improve it as I have more projects to showcase and a better grasp on the fundamentals and advanced methods. Thanks for taking a look!

## Credits ##
I learned how to embed a resume from [How to Embed PDF Document in HTML Webpage](https://www.codexworld.com/embed-pdf-document-file-in-html-web-page/#:~:text=Generally%2C%20a%20hyperlink%20is%20used,document%20on%20the%20web%20page). I also used ChatGPT to help me get the images, when clicked, lead
to the place-holder websites as well as other styling details. It helped me to get the work section's cards flex the way I wanted them to. The placeholder websites I used were StatMuse for MySQL, IMDb for MongoDB, an Online Calculator for JavaScript, and 
Spotify for Bootstrap. Of course, I did not program anything regarding these websites but they seemed like good stand-in applications from my understanding of what the associated programming languages could accomplish.

I had a tutoring session with Corrado Alfano on 10/15 (scheduled through the course Calendly) where he helped me to understand flexbox better and break the problem down into more manageable steps. I then further referenced the Week 2 Mini-Project for help.

For color inspiration, I looked through https://www.khroma.co/train and selected colors I enjoyed to put them together for this webpage.
